# Movie Data Analysis (IMDb Dataset)

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes IMDb movie data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in the film industry. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to answer questions like:

- Which genres are most popular over time?
- What is the distribution of movie ratings?

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills including handling datasets, visualizations, and interpreting results.

## Dataset
- Source: IMDb movie dataset (CSV file included in the repo)
- Content: Includes movie titles, release years, genres, ratings, and more
- Preprocessing: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and cleaned genre data for analysis

## Key Insights

1. IMDb Ratings Distribution:
Most movies are clustered between 6 and 8 IMDb ratings, indicating that average to good movies dominate the dataset. Extremely low or very high ratings are rare.

2. Ratings vs Revenue:
There is no strong correlation between IMDb ratings and revenue. Some highly rated movies earn less, while some moderately rated movies perform very well commercially. Commercial success depends on multiple factors beyond ratings.

3. Genre Ratings:
Animation and Biography movies consistently receive higher ratings, showing stronger audience appreciation. Other genres tend to have moderate ratings.

5. Revenue by Genre:
Animation and Action genres generate the most revenue, indicating strong audience preference and commercial success in these categories.

6. Overall Genre Trends:
- Drama and Comedy are the most frequently produced genres.
- Some genres may have fewer movies but generate higher average revenue, highlighting that production volume does not always equal profitability.
